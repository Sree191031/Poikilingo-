Building an AI-based Personalized Language Learning Model For Bilingual Children, Including Immigrants and Refugees 
oBJECTIVE : 

1.Build a personalized Recommendation system where the child’s study plan adapts to the level of the child as she progresses in the plan by collecting, analyzing, and inspecting the data. 

2.The system also will also recommend a plan based on profile similarities (ex. Children who are learning the same language and coming from the same culture could also share similar plans or activities.) 

3.The model synchronizes with the child’s progress within a given interval to improve the machine learning model. Ex. After 10 activities, recommend the next activity for the child. (the partner would want this “interval” to be easily updated by their team)  

4.Training the model to identify the child’s next steps based on the child’s progress in the study plan. A custom dashboard to analyze, collect, inspect, etc., all the data users (inputs), all the machine learning data, and the outputs.
